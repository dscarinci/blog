# About me

I'm Dana Scarinci. I'm a Spanish and English philologist and I have a masters in Cognitive Cience and Language. Besides, I'm a few credits away from finishing Computer engineering.

My work journey up to now has been quite colorful: from executive secretary in a food company in Japan to predoctoral researcher in Psycholinguistics at [BCBL](https://www.bcbl.eu), through other occupations such as text encoder for [CORPES XXI](https://www.rae.es/recursos/banco-de-datos/corpes-xxi), translator or teacher of Spanish as a second language.

Througout this journey, I've been submergin myself in the word of programming and data analysis. Now I work as freelance with researchers in linguisticky fields, where I have solid theoretical foundations. If you need help with programming an experiment, data analysis, a reply to a reviewer about your analysis, etc. you can write to me at: [unemail@unemail.com](""). I have experiencie with behavioural, eye-tracking, EEG data, etc.T

# About the blog

In this blog, I write mainly about:

- basic statistical concepts, explained the way I would have liked to have them explained to me, and using examples from language or literature,
- practical programming and data analysis examples,
- and little Linguistics projects.
